# Kinetic Components  

### User Code  
CodeTypeID: Modules  
CodeID: UnLic
(purpose and structure - the two-letter code for any module not licensed should be added to the tilde-delimited list in the Long Description field of this code to be excluded from the BAQs and dashboard, as those menus will otherwise appear but error rather than update)  


### BAQs   
MenusWithLayers  
MenusForScreen (parameter MainURL, nvarchar) (updateable)  


### Kinetic Dashboard  
Ice.UIDbd.MenuLayerManagement
